### Project Description

This project is an anti-motivational website designed with a singular, darkly humorous purpose: to demotivate users and subtly criticize their every effort, ultimately encouraging them to quit. Forget positive affirmations; this site is a digital dream killer, a constant reminder of futility, designed to break the user's spirit through an endless loop of unfulfilling tasks and cynical feedback

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

This project is an anti-motivational website designed to demotivate overly motivated people through continuous criticism of their efforts

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

This project offers a unique solution for "overly motivated people": to make them highly unmotivated and negative by using this app. It achieves this by constantly criticizing their efforts and presenting them with unending, unfulfilling tasks, effectively eroding their drive until they give up.
